# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

Leveraging data science skills while working as a Data Scientist for a private space launch company. This project begins with the crucial step of data collection from various sources to gather as much relevant data as possible. Once the raw data is collected, the focus shifts to enhancing data quality through data wrangling. Following this, explore the processed data delving into real-world datasets. This process involves practicing SQL skills for querying data and gaining insights.

We will further analyze the data through basic statistical methods and data visualization, helping identify relationships between variables. By grouping the data based on categorical variables, we will investigate it at a more granular level. This project's culmination involves constructing, evaluating, and refining predictive models to unveil exciting insights.

Ultimately, we will create a presentation that encapsulates the story of the analysis, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's findings.
